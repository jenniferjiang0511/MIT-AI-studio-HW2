MIT AI studio class HW2

My agent(s): 
1) I used the example LangChain Agent first, which
2) I then also tried to register my own agent, which can generate the latest fun facts based on my interests. 
   
Any feedback you have from using the adapter
1) It was a steep learning curve for me to set-up and get used to using EC2. I hope in the future, the adapter will be compatible with more hosts with simple integration, or even just a local machine.
2) Since the NANDA registry website isn't working, I hope that it gets fixed soon.
3) Overall, the integration was relatively straight forward.
